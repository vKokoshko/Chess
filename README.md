# Chess
Variation of chess using SFML library and HOMM sprites

This is the summary course project from the academy.
The goal was to make a game using all knowledge we've got during the course.
Most common decision was to make Tetris or some card game, but I decided to go further.

Since I had't much time (2-3 weeks) and I was working I didn't finish it. But the core is working.
Game lounches, controls are working. Animations work only for pawns (to fix this I have to manually make every sprite sheet fit).
Also there is some logging in console, so you can see what's happening.

Use left mouse click to select unit and right click to drop selection.
After unit is selected use left click for action (green fields - for moving; red fields - for attacking; blue fields - for curing (King has this ability))
